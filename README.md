## Usage
This is a generator of basefiles for cpp modules. By default it generates a Makefile, a .cpp and a .hpp ready to compile.
If, for example, we only want to generate a Makefile, we would do it as follows, and so on with the rest:

	basefiles_gen.py project_name -M
	
If we want to generate only the .cpp and .hpp files:

	basefiles_gen.py project_name -C -H
